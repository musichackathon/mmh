# Making changes

There are a few basic steps that will be common to any website change:

1. Create a branch
2. Make the changes
3. Create a pull request
4. Get comments or feedback from other organizers
5. Make further changes/commits as appropriate
5. Merge the branch

A more detailed description of that process can be found in the 
[Understanding the GitHub Flow Guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

## Changing one file easily

For small changes (such as updating this README.md or updating an event), 
the whole thing can be done on github.com without leaving the browser. 

To create a branch, make changes, and create a pull request:

1. Browse to the file
2. Click the pencil icon to edit the file and make your changes
3. In the 'Commit changes box' add 
[an appropriate title and description](https://github.com/blog/926-shiny-new-commit-styles).
4. *IMPORTANT*: Be sure to select the option "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull
request."
5. Click "Propose file change".
6. On the next screen, add one or more appropriate reviewers.
7. Click 'Create pull request'.
8. Address comments as needed.
9. When approved, submit with a "Squash and merge", cleaning up and updating the commit comment as needed. 

## To add a new event

The process to add a new event is similar to the process for making a small change and can also
completely be done in the browser.

1. Browse to the _events directory.
2. Open template.md and select and copy the contents.
3. Back in the _events directory, click, "Create a new file".
4. Paste the template into the new file.
5. Remove the first line of the ["front matter"](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), the one
that says, "published: false".
6. Update all the other fields and content as needed.
7. Follow the directions from step 3 above to write a description, create a new branch, 
propose changes, add reviewers, and create the pull request.

## Build someone else's changes

If someone has added you as a reviewer on a pull request, you can look at the changes locally by:

```sh
$ git fetch # pulls down all branches
$ git branch -a # shows you *all* of the branches prefixed by the remote name, e.g. origin/branch_for_review
$ git checkout branch_for_review
$ bundle exec jekyll serve # Serve the website on localhost:4000 like usual
````
