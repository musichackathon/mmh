Wow, it’s our birthday! We held our first Monthly Music Hackathon five years ago today.

We’ve since held 46 events with 6,575 unique attendees and 15,082 total RSVP’s.

Thank you to everyone who has ever participated in a Monthly Music Hackathon. Whether you gave a talk, led a workshop, performed, organized, closed captioned, created poster art, volunteered, made something, learned something, met someone, or even just helped us devour the pizzas.

Enjoy this collection of digital flyers from a few of our events from the past five years.

Flyers by Marshall Jones, Phillip Niemeyer, Kira Prentice, Athena Koumis, Jonathan Marmor, Diana Castro and others
