Kushagra Sharma, Manaswi Mishra, and Siddharth Bhardwaj, visiting us from [Music Hackathons Bulgaria](https://www.facebook.com/MusicHackathonsBG/) kicked off the presentations with the project that brough them to NY, [Samsara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQ7LbmPzRc&feature=youtu.be). They presented that, as well as the project they worked on at the hackathon, and were followed by Todd Gregory, Derek Bioh, Liam Baum, Patrick S. Lee, Adam November, Cole Mahlowitz, Jonathan Marmor, Antony Fonville, Tasdique, Sammy, Omar, and Aman. The projects ranged from apps (using music and visualizations and in support of performing artists), to cardboard and aluminum instruments, to a physical version of a beat generation app, to a musical composition created from a video recording.
