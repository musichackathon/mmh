The [New Musical Instruments Hackathon]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _events/2017-10-14.md %}), held on October 14, presented an opportunity for attendees to explore novel ways of making music, noise, and sound.

The event began with a series of speakers, who explained how their various projects correlated with
new musical instruments.

Our first speaker, [Kate Sicchio](http://blog.sicchio.com), opened participants up to the idea of using body motions and music technology to create interesting sounds and performances.

The next speaker, [Ranjit Bhatnagar](http://moonmilk.com), explained how, over 10 years, he has worked on his *Instrument-A-Day* project.

Following Ranjit, [Asha Iwanowicz](http://ashasounds.com) introduced participants to the concept of taking sound samples from the world around us and using them as instruments in modern music.

Next, [Lainie Fefferman](http://lainiefefferman.com) explained to participants how she herself found an instrument that fit her performance goals.

[Red Wierenga](https://roli.com/products/blocks) was the second to last speaker. He explained how participants could customize the BLOCKS program, and by doing so, make their own instruments.

[Anni Rossi](https://www.annirossi.com) closed out the talks.
She introduced the participants to the concept of modifying traditional instruments, using her viola as an electric guitar.

After the talks ended, some participants broke into pre-arranged groups while others brain-stormed their projects as a group. Others waited and mingled while waiting for workshops to begin.
