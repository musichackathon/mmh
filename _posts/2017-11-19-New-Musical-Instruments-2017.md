The [New Musical Instruments Hackathon]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _events/2017-10-14.md %}), held on October 14, presented an opportunity for attendees to explore novel ways of making music, noise, and sound.

The event began with a series of speakers, who explained how their various projects correlated with
new musical instruments. Our first speaker, [Kate Sicchio](http://blog.sicchio.com), opened participants up to the idea of using body motions and music technology to create interesting sounds and performances.

The next speaker, [Ranjit Bhatnagar](http://moonmilk.com), explained how, over 10 years, he has worked on his *Instrument-A-Day* project.
