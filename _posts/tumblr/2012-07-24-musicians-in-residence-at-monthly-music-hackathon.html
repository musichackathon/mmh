<p><strong><em>Didier Aschour:</em></strong> is an experimental guitarist and composer from France. He’s in NYC for the summer on a grant from the French Institute working with American composers Christian Wolff, Alvin Lucier, Pauline Oliveros, and others. His performances — both solo and with his acclaimed ensemeble Dedalus — of the music of Tom Johnson, Harry Partch, James Tenney, and Michael Pisaro are widely praised. He’ll be available to collaborate with you on music for electric and acoustic guitar, and will perform his composition <em>Buzzing</em> which explores a technique to make multiphonic sounds with the guitar. <br/><a href="http://ex.fm/song/ho1xf">Piste 15 by Tom Johnson</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Joe Drew:</em></strong> is a fantastic trumpet player, keyboardist, composer, and Stockhausen scholar based in NYC. His 9-, 12-, and 24-hour performances of John Cage’s ASLSP are legendary. He’ll also be collaborating with the hackers on music for trumpet, and will perform a piece for trumpet and pre-recorded sound. <br/><a href="http://ex.fm/song/1949k">ASLSP by John Cage <br/><br/></a></p>
