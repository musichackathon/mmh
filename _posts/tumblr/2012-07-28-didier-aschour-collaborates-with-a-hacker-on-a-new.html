<blockquote>
<p><em>When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.</em></p>
<p align="right">—“Paragraphs on Conceptual Art” by Sol LeWitt, <em>Artforum</em>, June 1967</p>
