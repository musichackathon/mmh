<p>Great article by Andrew Mager below.  I&rsquo;d add to this that hackathons don&rsquo;t necessarily require technology at all.  They can be valuable experiences for anyone who makes things, particularly artists.  I find that quickly going through the entire lifecycle of writing a new piece of music on a regular basis keeps me limber for larger scale projects: I try out and discard ideas I might otherwise get hung up on, and repeating the creation process makes progress to each stage more automatic.</p>

<p>When people hear the word “hacker”, one of the first thoughts that comes to mind is someone breaking into a computer. But in computer programmer subculture, “hacking” refers to building something quickly, testing the limits of technology, or learning a new way to solve a problem.</p>
<p>Hackathons are where hackers gather to test and invent these skills. But hackathons aren’t just for computer scientists and software developers. Here are some other types of people that make hackathons successful:</p>
<ul><li>Designers: Everyone knows that engineers aren’t always the best designers. Designers bring creativity, vision, and user experience to a hack. A hackathon with a lot of designers brings a special sense of style and art to the event.</li>
<li>Business minds: A small percentage of hackathon projects become actual products, and one reason is that when they are being created, no one thinks of a business plan. Biz dev folks add value to hackathons, almost as the devil’s advocate, to test and challenge an idea.</li>
<li>Marketing sharks/product ninjas: You need to be realistic about what you’re building, and make sure it would be a usable product. These creative minds will help balance out a successful team at a hackathon.</li>
<li>Other experts: for example, a music hackathon should include music fans, producers, DJs, artists, record labels. Art hackathons have painters, graphic designers, LEGOmasters, and seamstresses.</li>
<li>You: if you haven’t been to a hackathon, put your skills out there. I participated in StartupBus 2011, a three-day roadtrip from San Francisco to Austin, Tx for South By Southwest. People pitched ideas at the beginning of the trip, teams formed, and we hacked together a product before we got to the festival. There were people of all skillsets on the bus, including people that didn’t even have a Twitter account. We had a team nanny, who refilled our Red Bull and helped us with the video production of our final pitch. Everyone’s skills were utilized.</li>
</ul><p>In his letter to investors yesterday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg explains how his company practices a philosophy called “The Hacker Way”. Every few months, they do internal hackathons that include everybody, not just programmers. The result is a more focused, open, socially valuable working environment.</p></blockquote>
