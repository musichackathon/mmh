<a href="http://www.mattmcvicar.com/music-hackathon-october-2012/">Audio processing scripts ported to Python</a><br/><p>Columbia&rsquo;s Matt McVicar (along with others) ported Dan Ellisâ€™ audio processing scripts from MATLAB to Python at the October 2012 Monthly Music Hackathon NYC.  The code is here: <a href="https://github.com/bmcfee/librosa.">https://github.com/bmcfee/librosa.</a>  </p>

<p>He also made a demonstration of what&rsquo;s possible with this new library by making a tool to automatically &ldquo;gear shift&rdquo; any pop song.  To hear samples and learn more about what Matt made, check out his blog post about it: <a href="http://www.mattmcvicar.com/music-hackathon-october-2012/.">http://www.mattmcvicar.com/music-hackathon-october-2012/.</a></p>
