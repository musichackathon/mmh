<p>At the February 2013 Music Hackathon NYC, Jamie Burkart made a Max/MSP program that breaks up audio into small segments and sorts them based on some feature of the clips.  He says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ooops, I broke Spencer Owen&rsquo;s song Jeu des Treize (spencerowen.bandcamp.com/track/jeu-des-treize) into tiny pieces. I tried to put it back together, sorting the pieces by pitch. Here you go!&rdquo;</p>
