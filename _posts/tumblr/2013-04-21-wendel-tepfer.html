<p>Jazz duo Ben Wendel &amp; Dan Tepfer will be our special guest ensemble at Jazz &amp; Technology Forum.  In addition to hacking together new music and tech projects to perform in the concert, they will also play material from their recent critically acclaimed album <a href="http://sunnysidezone.com/album/small-constructions">Small Constructions</a>.</p>

<p>Dan has a background in astrophysics and has incorporated technology into some of his music.  He recently did a project in which he used a keyboard midi controller to send music notation to iPhones being read by the Harlem String Quartet.  This allowed him to improvise a string quartet accompaniment to legendary saxophonist Lee Konitz.  Check it out <a href="http://youtu.be/4FDG11qajPk">here</a>.</p>
