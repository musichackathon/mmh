<blockquote><p>Here’s a short interview I did about Jazz &amp; Technology Forum:</p>

<p>Jonathan Marmor composes experimental music, writes software for exfm, helps coordinate Monthly Music Hackathon NYC and plays tabla. He’s one of the primary instigators behind this weekend’s Jazz and Technology Forum at Ace Hotel New York in honor of UNESCO International Jazz Day. We had a sit down with him about some stuff he knows about.</p>

<p>+ What is Music Information Retrieval and how does it interest you?</p>

<p>Music Information Retrieval (MIR), or Music Information Research, as it’s frequently called these days, is a field of science focused on using computer science techniques such as digital signal processing and machine-learning to better understand music. A classic example is the challenge of automatically classifying a large collection of audio files into genres, based entirely on the characteristics of the audio signal.</p>

<p>I’ve personally always been interested in learning about how music functions and making up my own rules for my music. MIR scientists approach analyzing music differently than anything I ever experienced in music school or studying Indian music. It was eye-opening and revealed I had been underestimating the number of unanswered basic questions about how music works. This opened up many new avenues for speculation on musical fantasy worlds. It’s like there was a box with a hundred knobs, and now that box has an unknown but much larger number of knobs.</p>

<p>+ What kinds of projects span the code/music relationship?</p>

<p>At Monthly Music Hackathon NYC we’ve had an incredible variety of projects spanning music and technology. One of my favorites is a wind harp built out of a metal rain gutter, driven by a computer controlled fan. One of the inspirations for this jazz-focused hackathon was Ben Lacker’s Jazz Drum Machine, which chops up audio files of jazz drum solos, classifies all the segments by pitch characteristics and positions within the meter, then allows you to fade in and out loops of related sounds. It shows how having data describing audio can lead to really beautiful and unexpected art. Ben will be speaking at the Jazz &amp; Technology Forum about how data generated by MIR tools can be used to create new music.</p>

<p>+ What do you think some ideal pairings of skill sets would be?</p>

<p>I’d love to see someone with a deep knowledge of jazz history, a data scientist and an interactive artist team up to create a visualization (with audio) demonstrating a seemingly inconsequential nuance that makes jazz expressive, such as the variations in pitch intonation in 100 performances of the head of St. Louis Blues.</p>
