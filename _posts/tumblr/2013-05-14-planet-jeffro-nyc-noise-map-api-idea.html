<a href="http://planetjeffro.com/post/46796717580/nyc-noise-map-api-idea">Planet Jeffro: NYC "Noise Map" API idea</a><br/><p>Two interesting and overlapping projects dealing with urban noise explained below.  The potential uses of this data for artistic purposes is exciting.  Anyone interested in doing a project at Monthly Music Hackathon NYC exploring urban noise in New York?</p>



<p>Jeff Novich has an excellent proposal for an urban noise API:</p>

<p><a href="http://planetjeffro.com/post/46796717580/nyc-noise-map-api-idea" class="tumblr_blog">planetjeffro</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine the applications of a Noise API:</p>

<p>I’d create a simple “noise map” website using the noise API that would allow users to explore NYC through noise.  This would merely represent a use-case of the API.  There are many, many other uses of the data that I can imagine, and I know the ingenuity and innovation of NYC techies will find even more interesting ways to utilize the data.</p>

<ul><li>Add a “noise” layer into Zillow and other rental maps</li>
<li>Compare locations with “don’t honk” signs to places without them</li>
<li>Identify ambulance routes by tracing the “ambulance siren” noise type</li>
<li>Identify poorly designed intersections that have higher than average honking</li>
<li>Compare high honking locations with taxi GPS data to (possibly) identify honking taxis</li>
<li>Use the “bus honk” type to identify buses that are honking inappropriately</li>
<li>Play sounds of honking loudly at a community board meeting</li></ul></blockquote>

<p>
And coincidentally, NYU is embarking on a project researching urban noise:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New York University’s Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) and the Music and Audio Research Lab (MARL) invite applications for a post-doctoral position in cyberphysical systems’ research and development involving large-scale capture, analysis, classification, retrieval, and visualization of urban noise.</p>

<p>These research activities form part of an interdisciplinary initiative, integrating MARL’s Citygram project, that aims to: (a) design and deploy large-scale remote sensing networks that capture spatio-acoustic properties of NYC&rsquo;s metropolitan area in real-time; (b) design systems for automatic sound identification; &copy; develop tools for both mining existing databases and collecting new noise complaints and associated acoustic events; and (d) provide an online exploration/research hub for spatio-acoustic “big data” access, navigation, and visualization. Research results will enable deeper understanding of the NYC noise problem and thus inform effective public policy. Main areas of research include: wireless sensor networks; soundfield capture, analysis and classification; and visualization of spatio-acoustic properties with a focus on urban noise.</p></blockquote>
