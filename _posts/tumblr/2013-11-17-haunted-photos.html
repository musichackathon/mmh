As you exited the elevator, you encountered a vibrating pile of amplified halloween noisemaking toys, systematic multichannel sound patterns swirling around a reverberant rotunda, a business meeting of disembodied jack-o-lantern heads with speakers for mouths, sounds of a trapped man emanating from a closet, a scene in an office moments after a suicide in the 1920&rsquo;s, a glowing turntable driving a pulsating handmade analog synthesizer, a shakuhachi flute driven by the electrical activity of the performer&rsquo;s heart, and a walk down a long, dark, foggy hallway into swelling sound effects, an ever brighter light, and a floating hologram of a door.</p>
