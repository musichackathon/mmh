<p>Announcing a few exciting changes to Monthly Music Hackathon&rsquo;s 2015 schedule.</p>

<h3>Soundscapes hackathon</h3>

<p>April 25 is now a Soundscapes hackathon. Soundscapes are the full auditory scene a person perceives. For Earth Day, we&rsquo;re partnering with NYU&rsquo;s CityGram project to present talks, workshops, and a hackathon on a wide range of subjects related to soundscapes: audio sensor networks, noise pollution, immersive sound art, research on the auditory systems of non-human animals, and more. Hack on your own projects, NYU&rsquo;s data, and possibly other data sources and challenges to be announced. We&rsquo;ll likely also turn a large side room into an all-day, collaborative, open-to-anyone, immersive sound art installation, with a focus on soundscapes, environmental sound, and spatialized sound.</p>

<h3>Rhythm &amp; Time Hackathon</h3>

<p>The Rhythm &amp; Time in music hackathon has been moved to June 20th, 2015.</p>

<h3>New Musical Instruments</h3>

<p>Our second annual New Musical Instruments Hackathon will be done in three parts: Friday night at 8pm, July 24th, 2015, there will be talks and performances by both acclaimed and reclusive experimental musical instrument builders. Saturday, July 25th from Noon to 8pm please come hack on a new musical instrument &ndash; whatever that means to you. At 8pm on Saturday, July 25th, the hackers will present their work made that day, most likely including some first-ever performances on unusual instruments.</p>

<h3>Sound Visualization &amp; Data Sonification</h3>

<p>These two subjects have been combined into one event, December 12th, 2015.</p>

<h3>Lyrics &amp; Language</h3>

<p>The Lyrics &amp; Language in music hackathon has been moved to January 30, 2016.</p>

<h3>Automatic Music III</h3>

<p>The Automatic Music Hackathon last month was so great we decided to go ahead and schedule another one for next year. Our 3rd annual hackathon devoted to algorithmic music composition will be Saturday, February 27, 2016</p>
