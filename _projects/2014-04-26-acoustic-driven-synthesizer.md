creator_names: ["Dylan Sherry"]

Dylan Sherry is a saxophonist and computer scientist who works with genetic programming for data mining. At the Jazz Hackathon he used SuperCollider to follow the pitch of an acoustic signal and trigger a synth with the same pitches. The process of translating from the acoustic sound to the very dry synthesizer is not perfect, which creates a very nice glitchy effect. (Audio sample coming soon!)
