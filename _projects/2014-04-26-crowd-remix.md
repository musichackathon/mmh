C.J. made a lovely [website](http://cortexel.us/crowdremix/crowdremix.php) that turns any song (any audio, actually) into a musical instrument. It uses The Echo Nest Remix API to break the song up into tiny segments and get audio analysis for each chunk. The song is visually layed out in a strip across the screen with segments clustered together based on timbral quality. As you scrub your mouse across the strip each segment loops, creating a sweeping granular synthesis type of sound. Play around with it yourself here: {http://cortexel.us/crowdremix/crowdremix.php](http://cortexel.us/crowdremix/crowdremix.php).
