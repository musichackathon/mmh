I spent the majority of the Jazz Hackathon doing something not particularly jazzy: preparing my late friend Harris Wulfson’s piece LiveScore for a performance at the SPOR Festival for Contemporary Music and Sound Art [http://www.sporfestival.dk/](http://www.sporfestival.dk/). It’s a fascinating piece. Several musicians with acoustic instruments read parts that are generated in real time based on input from a bank of knobs which the audience is invited to play with. The code is here if you’re interested: [https://github.com/harriswulfson/livescore](https://github.com/harriswulfson/livescore)
