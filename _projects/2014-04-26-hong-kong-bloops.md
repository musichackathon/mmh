Brian applied his infamous [AutoChipTune](http://evolver.fm/2012/11/15/listen-what-if-lady-gaga-and-wham-made-chiptunes/) technology to the old tune "[Hong Kong Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmKQOxB6lpI&feature=youtu.be)" by [Hoagie Carmichael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoagy_Carmichael), which you may know from the movie [To Have Or Have Not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUn4DOGiY_A). But converting this 1939 masterpiece into a video game caricature wasnâ€™t enough. He also extracted the lead vocal from the original and layered it over the chip tune version. I love how it sounds retro in two different ways.
