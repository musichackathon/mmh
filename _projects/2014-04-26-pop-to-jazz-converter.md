This project was a brilliant idea that could easily be a 5 year project. It’s shocking they got so much of it done in 8 hours. The premise is that much jazz is derived from popular music. A simplified description of the process might be: a characteristic element or section of the pop piece is played by an ensemble, then the rhythm and harmonies are looped while soloists take turns elaborating on the melodic thematic material of the original song, then the characteristic section from the beginning is repeated by the whole ensemble. The goal of the project was to make a machine that automatically remixes the audio of a pop song into a new jazz song. I won’t describe their technical process here, but you can find Brian or C.J. on the internet if you want to ask them about it.

Wonderful quote from C.J.: “What I love about jazz is that it takes something you’re familiar with then fucks with it until your mind is blown.”
