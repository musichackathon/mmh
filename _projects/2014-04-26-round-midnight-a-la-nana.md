Candida Haynes is a singer and programmer. At the Jazz Hackathon, she made a lovely mashup of “‘Round Midnight”, the Ladino song “A La Nana”, and her original “Somewhere.” We were treated to her live a capella singing accompanied by herself with an effect that looped her voice which she manipulated in real time.
