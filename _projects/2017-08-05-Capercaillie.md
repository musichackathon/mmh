Jonathan: *I wanted to take an audio sample of a [Capercaillie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_capercaillie), a giant grouse bird, my friend Andreas made in the Swedish forest, and make a little music composition out of it, that plays on the accelerating clicking sounds the Capercaillie makes. Using software I made a few weekends ago that lets you easily make many parallel repeating copies of a sample go out of phase with each other, I layered this sample so that it gradual comes into phase.*

This technique, of creating a piece from repeating rhythmic patterns and slowly phase shifting them against one another, is reminiscent of Steve Reich's.

The technologies used in this project include:
python, pysox, audacity (to clean up the original sample and do some minor edits of the finished product).
