GrooveGyan is a multimodal groove creator and rhythm learning tool. The goal was to create an app for making and sharing multimodal grooves. The grooves are composed of three types of sensory onsets - sounds, vibrations and lights).
The design of this app emphasizes accessibility and education.

Team: *We were able to create the skeleton version of the app and standardize multimodal grooves. By the end of the event, we were not able to implement scoring of grooves by users, for better learning rhythms. We plan to after the event. We learned about the importance of accessibility through this project.*

The technologies used in this project include:
Android.
