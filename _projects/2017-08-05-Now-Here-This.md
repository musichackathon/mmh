This app is helps music lovers and artists find your local artists, wherever you are currently on the road. It helps you build playlists based on locality, which is a different approach to music discovery than Discover Weekly, Fresh Finds, or other music discovery tools. As of the end of the hackathon, it was still in development.

The technologies used in this project include:
Spotify API.
