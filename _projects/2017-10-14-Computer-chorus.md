![Katya and Nicolas present the Computer Chorus. They stand in front of the Graphical User Interface of their demo, and Katya explains a bit of the theory behind how it works. Nicolas stands slightly in front of the screen, and the stenographer's display is in the background. ](/assets/events/20171014/DSCF8954.jpg)

Katya and Nicolas: *We wanted to create a computer chorus. In the end, it turned into a call and response 'singing' platform. We learned... a lot!*

The team set out to enhance Katya's voice as a musical instrument. The computer took vocal input, and output 'sung' words. A javascript library was used to create speech. This project is not guaranteed to be safe for use at work.

The team plans on improving on their project. Some potential improvements include fixing polyphony issues.

The technologies used in this project include:
p5js, HTML.
