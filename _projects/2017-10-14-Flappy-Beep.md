Adam took a [Flappy Birds](http://flappybird.io) clone and made it into a musical instrument. As you play the game, you control the musical effects. You can play alone, or, through the use of web sockets, you can play the game and make music together with an unlimited number of players.

The instrument and game are customizable. You can change the background color through live coding, and change how the frequency works. You can make the game easier to play by making the blocks smaller, changing their positions, etc. You can even make the game into a jumping game instead of a flying game.

The technologies used in this project include:
d3, websockets, webaudio.

You can [play the game](roadtolarissa.com/flappy-beep) on [Adam](roadtolarissa.com/)'s website, or contact him to [learn more about the project](https://twitter.com/adamrpearce).
