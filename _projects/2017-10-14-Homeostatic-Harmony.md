Shawn, Luke, Will, Nicola, & Daniel: *We wanted to create a way to make music that takes data from a human body as input and maps it to a sound output. Different processes of the human body would be mapped to different sounds that combine to create a piece of music.*

The team took inspiration from [homeostatic systems](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/homeostatic). Their goal was to make music that changed and regulated itself based off of body inputs. The team ended up using samples of body sounds (heartbeats, breathing, etc.) to create music and flesh out their idea.

The technologies used in this project include:
Ableton, max msp.
