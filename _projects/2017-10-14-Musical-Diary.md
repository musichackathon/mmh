Alvin, Mikhail, Ryan, & Eren: *We created a webscraper that take a page, and renders its text as music.*

The team generated music for any website based off of the page's text. The beginning letter of each word helped set the bass note of a chord. The rest of the notes were chosen to fit in with the key of the piece.

The technologies used in this project include:
React, Redux, Express, Node, Web Audio API.
