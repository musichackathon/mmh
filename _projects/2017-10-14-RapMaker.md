Ana: *I used a boilerplate.  I learned how to divide things in a project better.*

Ana's project took typed text from an interface. The project then isolated the last word in the text string and suggested words that would go with it. The project also kept track of the number of syllables per line. This process generated rap-like lyrics, and could assist an aspiring rapper in creative process.

The technologies used in this project include:
ReactJS, datamuse and syllable APIs.
