Stephen's instrument was a real-time reprogrammable MIDI controller. He hooked up sensors to an arduino, and played midi notes. The goal was to play easily with different scales, and display colors as you play notes.

Future improvements include fixing an incompatibility between capacitance sensor manufacturers, so that 100% of the sensors work.

The technologies used in this project include:
Arduino, capacitance touch sensors, MIDI.
