Mustafa & Paul: *We learned the basics of Clojure syntax and how to combine examples in Overtone. We wanted to make Euclidean rhythms controllable by touch to vary the number of notes and rests, as well as pitches. It is difficult to make the list of rhythms change in real-time, since they are evaluated as a hard-coded list in Clojure.*

Mustafa and Paul explored the mathematical relationships of rhythms. Using combinations of notes, spaces, and Greatest Common Divisors, they could generate different world rhythms. When combined with the Overtone Project, and a sample Theremin, they got interesting music.

Future work includes connecting the two demos, and creating a complete piece.

The technologies used in this project include:
Overtone, Clojure, TouchOSC.
