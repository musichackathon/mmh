Charile & Devon: *We implemented a microtone system in Charlie's existing iOS app, "expressionPad".*

This project provides an easy way to play with microtones.

The project took the [expressionPad](http://expressionpad.com) app, which is a midi controller, and added features. They took a 12 tone scale, based off of A440, and made it possible for a user of the app to switch to using any number of variations on the scale. Instead of being stuck with 12 tones, the user has total control over which frequency divisions he uses.


The technologies used in this project include:
expressionPad, AudioKit, Swift.
