James: *I wanted to use the mobile device motion and orientation APIs as inputs for music, but I was unable to get that to work on my laptop or cell phone. So I instead decided to make a synthesizer with 8 different waveforms stacked together, which can be played using a keyboard.*

Jame's modular synthesizer had modules that each completed one specific audio task. It was a modular synthesizer. It used oscillators, changes of frequency, and a voice controlled amplifier to create interesting sounds.

The technologies used in this project include:
javascript, html audio.

Check out the [project](http://bit.ly/2yK7dxY), and hear some of the sounds! To learn more about the project, reach out to [James Mayr](https://github.com/jamesbmayr).
