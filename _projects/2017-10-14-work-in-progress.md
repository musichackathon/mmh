title: App/String Instrument Combo
creator_names: ['Desmond']
---
Desmond's presentation  was of a new app/string instrument combo. The ios app was run from inside the string instrument, and while playing both the acoustic string instrument and running the app, he could get interesting sounds. The iphone took samples, and sent the vibrations through the acoustic instrument.

While Desmond's instrument was fascinating, he hopes to improve it, and have it demo even more smoothly in the future.

The technologies used in this project include:
ios, audiobus.
