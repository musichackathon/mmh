Bill incorporated RTcmix into a Unity game for spatial audio.

The idea: Fly over a map, such as google maps, hit an attraction, and have some sort of interactive experience, over the attraction. The interactive experience includes sound.

The technologies used in this project include:
Unity, RTCmix.
