In one of the hackathon workshops, participants collaborated to make a list of [Science of Music Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cEkcjvsJU5KIhi--S1tOJGSVTMQJcD72A_6awwgpXt8/edit#heading=h.uqt8zgbqs3kg). Jason and Eric kicked off the discussion, and moderated it, but the work itself? It was done by all of the wonderful participants.

The technologies used in this project include:
google docs, twitter, talking to people.
